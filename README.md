# ktcoin

This is a work-in-progress attempt to implement the fundamental ideas
from the original Bitcoin whitepaper: a virtual currency built on
cryptographic signatures and collected into a distributed ledger,
implemented as a blockchain.

# Status

It doesn't work!

There's a full implementation of cryptographically-signed and verified
transactions, but the blockchain part doesn't work yet and none of the
networking necessary to run multiple nodes is in place.

Check back soon!
